* Party time.

# DCO: Sign your work

The sign-off is a simple line at the end of the explanation for the
patch, which certifies that you wrote it or otherwise have the right to
pass it on as an open-source patch. The rules are pretty simple: if you
can certify the below (from
[developercertificate.org](https://developercertificate.org/)):

```
Developer Certificate of Origin
Version 1.1

Copyright (C) 2004, 2006 The Linux Foundation and its contributors.
660 York Street, Suite 102,
San Francisco, CA 94110 USA

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
license document, but changing it is not allowed.


Developer's Certificate of Origin 1.1

By making a contribution to this project, I certify that:

(a) The contribution was created in whole or in part by me and I
    have the right to submit it under the open source license
    indicated in the file; or

(b) The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the best
    of my knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source
    license and I have the right under that license to submit that
    work with modifications, whether created in whole or in part
    by me, under the same open source license (unless I am
    permitted to submit under a different license), as indicated
    in the file; or

(c) The contribution was provided directly to me by some other
    person who certified (a), (b) or (c) and I have not modified
    it.

(d) I understand and agree that this project and the contribution
    are public and that a record of the contribution (including all
    personal information I submit with it, including my sign-off) is
    maintained indefinitely and may be redistributed consistent with
    this project or the open source license(s) involved.
```

then you just add a line to every git commit message:

    Signed-off-by: Joe Smith <joe@gmail.com>

using your real name (sorry, no pseudonyms or anonymous contributions.)

You can add the sign off when creating the git commit via `git commit -s`.

If you want this to be automatic you can set up some aliases:

```bash
git config --add alias.amend "commit -s --amend"
git config --add alias.c "commit -s"
```

## Fixing DCO

If your PR fails the DCO check, it's necessary to fix the entire commit history in the PR. Best
practice is to [squash](https://gitready.com/advanced/2009/02/10/squashing-commits-with-rebase.html)
the commit history to a single commit, append the DCO sign-off as described above, and [force
push](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-push#git-push---force). For example, if you have 2 commits in
your history:

```bash
git rebase -i HEAD^^
(interactive squash + DCO append)
git push origin -f
```

Note, that in general rewriting history in this way is a hindrance to the review process and this
should only be done to correct a DCO mistake.
